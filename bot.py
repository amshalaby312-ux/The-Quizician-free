#  505   ANALYTICS — XP · LEVELS · ACHIEVEMENTS (also: telegram_name /
#          telegram_username via _update_telegram_name). ACHIEVEMENTS
#          holds 7 tiered categories: questions_answered, correct_streak,
#          lectures_completed, xp_levels, daily_quiz, daily_streak (tier
#          counts vary 4-6, see the dict itself and ACHIEVEMENT_STAT_FIELD
#          for which analytics field each checks), and the meta category
#          achievement_collector — thresholds check
#          _total_achievements_unlocked (every OTHER category's unlocked
#          tiers + unlocked extras) rather than a normal field, and its
#          tiers grant a permanent entry["xp_multiplier"] instead of a
#          one-time XP bonus; every _award_xp call scales by it, and tier
#          5 (only reachable once literally everything else is unlocked)
#          renames to "The Quizician". EXTRA_ACHIEVEMENTS holds 5 one-off
#          (non-tiered) awards — quick_thinker, basmagy, perfect_run,
#          insomniac, curious (the last checked via _settings_customized,
#          no dedicated tracker) — unlocked
#          via _check_extra_achievement and stored in
#          entry["achievements"]["extras"]. New counters this system
#          added: lectures_completed (_finish_lecture_session, non-retake
#          only) and daily_quizzes_completed (_advance_daily_quiz_session,
#          on completion).
#  927   SETTINGS — per-user personalization (nickname, reactions,
#          auto_next, randomize)
#        🔎 SEARCH CONTENT — "Search Content 🔎" button on the Quizzes
#          module list (and the rare no-locked-year fallback picker).
#          search_pick_year:/search_year:/search_mod: callbacks (grep
#          "SEARCH CONTENT" in button_handler) walk year -> module (or
#          "All Modules") -> arms AWAITING_SEARCH_QUERY, then the user's
#          next text message is matched against every ready lecture's
#          poll questions via _search_quiz_questions (Arabic-aware
#          substring match, same normalization as the nickname filter).
#          Results are resent as fresh live quiz polls straight into the
#          chat via deliver_quiz (channel is private, so linking out
#          isn't reliable). See _send_search_results for the shared send
#          used by both the search itself and its "🔎 Search Again" button.
# 1114   LECTURE RESULTS — per-lecture leaderboard (own file + own
#          backup channel: LECTURE_RESULTS_GROUP_ID)
# 1267   MISTAKES BANK — per-user wrong-answer pool that seeds each user's
#          own Daily Quiz "questions you got wrong before" slice. Entries
#          are lightweight {user_id, mid, year, module, subject}
#          REFERENCES, not full question snapshots — record_mistake()
#          stores just the id; _resolve_mistake(s) turns a reference back
#          into a full question dict on demand via _snapshot_from_mid +
#          QUIZ_POLL_STATUS[year].
#          Grep "_resolve_mistake" for every call site that needs resolved
#          content (_build_daily_quiz_questions, start_mistakes_retake).

#          practice quiz over _scoped_mistakes_bank() (resolved first)
# 1863   PASSWORD-GATED STORAGE (private group) — unrelated to quiz
#          content; this is the password-triggered media vault. Its backup
#          file is quizician_storage_backup.json (singular, no year
#          suffix) — do NOT confuse with each year's Quizician_Quiz_Backup
#          file below, despite the similar "storage/backup" wording.
# 1986   QUIZ CHANNELS (per-year: YEARS registry near the top of the file
#          controls channel_id + curriculum per year; index/state/poll-status/
#          backup are all keyed by year, e.g. QUIZ_INDEX[year]). Each
#          year's pinned backup document is named
#          Quizician_Quiz_Backup_Y1.json / _Y2.json / _Y3.json
#          (backup_quiz_to_channel) and contains quiz_index + quiz_state +
#          quiz_poll_status for that year — this is what MISTAKES BANK
#          entries resolve against.
# 2212   STATE (in-memory dicts: LECTURE_SESSIONS, QUIZ_POLL_STATUS, etc.
#          QUIZ_POLL_STATUS is persisted per-year alongside QUIZ_INDEX/
#          QUIZ_STATE — see QUIZ CHANNELS above. LECTURE_SESSIONS,
#          DAILY_QUIZ_SESSIONS, and MISTAKES_RETAKE_SESSIONS are now also
#          persisted — see SESSION PERSISTENCE (grep the banner) for the
#          local-file + SESSIONS_GROUP_ID channel backup, restored in
#          _post_init. A crash within the ~30s SESSIONS_BACKUP_MIN_INTERVAL
#          window can still lose that window's worth of session progress,
#          same accepted risk shape as the analytics flush.)
# 2238   CONSTANTS
# 2247   PER-USER SERIALIZATION — @_serialize_per_user decorator, applied
#          to handle_poll_answer and button_handler. Needed because
#          concurrent_updates() (see MAIN, near the bottom) lets different
#          users' updates run truly concurrently now; this keeps each
#          individual user's own updates ordered against each other via a
#          private asyncio.Lock per user_id, without touching either
#          handler's body.

#          callback_data routing, including lecture preview/leaderboard,
#          lecture start, settings toggles, and the /edit_quiz flow —
#          eqyr:/eqmodule:/eqsubject:/eqlecture:/eqq:/eqdel:/eqins:,
#          admin-only, parallel to yr:/module:/subject:/lecture: — lets an
#          admin drill into a lecture, pick one question (16-char
#          preview), then delete it or reopen the lecture in the quiz
#          channel to insert new poll(s) right after it via
#          QUIZ_INSERT_AFTER, closed the same way as authoring: -END)
# 5437   START (also wakes bot from sleep; asks for a nickname on first use)
# 5505   ADMIN HELPERS — is_admin, /dev_panel (Creator-only control panel:
#          stats snapshot + Set year/Users/Backups/Daily module shortcuts,
#          replaces the old /admincheck), /set_year (nickname/ID -> year
#          picker, also reachable from the panel — see
#          AWAITING_DEVPANEL_SETYEAR/_MYSTATS and _resolve_user_ref)
# 5526   BROADCAST COMMAND (admin only)
# 5603   MAIN — ApplicationBuilder here sets .concurrent_updates(256), so
#          updates from different users are handled in parallel instead of
#          one-at-a-time globally (see PER-USER SERIALIZATION above for
#          how same-user ordering is still preserved). Also where
#          _reconcile_backups_job lives: a job_queue.run_repeating() job
#          (every BACKUP_RECONCILE_INTERVAL seconds) that re-checks each
#          backup channel's pin and re-uploads if it's out of sync, so a
#          missed pin/delete on the reactive path gets caught within a few
#          seconds instead of waiting for the next real data change. Also
#          registers _zikr_push_job (job_queue.run_repeating, every 3600s,
#          first fire aligned to the next real clock-hour via
#          _next_top_of_hour_delay) — hourly zikr to every user who hasn't
#          opted out via Settings -> More Settings -> Hourly Zikr
#          (get_zikr_enabled, on by default). Also registers
#          _daily_backup_export_job (job_queue.run_daily,
#          DAILY_BACKUP_EXPORT_HOUR/MIN) — zips every local data file and
#          sends it to ERROR_LOG_GROUP_ID once a day, as a flat-file
#          backup on top of the per-system pinned-message backups.
#
# NOTE ON save_*() FUNCTIONS: all 11 are async, writing via
# asyncio.to_thread(_atomic_write_json, ...) — atomic (temp file + fsync +
# os.replace, so a crash can't leave a half-written JSON file) AND
# non-blocking (the disk I/O runs in a worker thread instead of stalling
# the event loop for every other user while one save is in flight). Every
# call site must `await` them; a few originally-sync helper functions
# (_record_activity, set_daily_quiz_scope, _record_lecture_result,
# record_mistake, _index_item) became async too since they call save_*()
# internally — grep any of these names before adding a new call site.
#
# NOTE: line numbers drift as the file grows — treat them as "roughly
# here", and confirm with a grep for the section banner text if unsure.

# ── YEARS — one quiz channel + curriculum per academic year ──────────
# /quiz now asks "which year?" first, then drills into that year's own
# modules -> subjects -> lectures, exactly like before. Each year is
# completely isolated: its own Telegram channel, its own quiz index, its
# own backup document. That isolation is the whole point — a single
# combined index/backup eventually outgrows Telegram's practical JSON
# document size as more years/lectures pile in, so splitting by year
# keeps each backup small indefinitely instead of one ever-growing file.
#
# To add/wire up a year's channel:
#   1. Create a channel, add this bot as an ADMIN (channels require admin
#      rights for the bot to receive posts at all).
#   2. Forward any message from that channel to @userinfobot in a private
#      DM — it replies with the channel's chat ID.
#   3. Paste that ID below as that year's "channel_id".
#
# The old single-channel setup (channel -1004402622263) is kept as Year 3
# below, repurposed and started fresh — its lecture index/state/poll-status
# are stored under new "_y3" files, so nothing from the old combined
# quiz_index.json/quiz_state.json/quiz_poll_status.json carries over.
#
# Subject names here are plain text, no emoji — this is the exact string
# admins type in a lecture title ("<Module> - <Subject> Lecture <n>: ...")
# and the exact string stored in QUIZ_INDEX, so it needs to stay simple and
# typeable. Emoji are purely cosmetic and live in SUBJECT_EMOJI below,
# looked up only when rendering a subject as a button label.

# ── Serialized concurrent writers ───────────────────────────────────
# _atomic_write_json makes ONE write crash-safe, but it does nothing about
# TWO writes to the same file overlapping. Every save_*() hands its write to
# asyncio.to_thread, so two saves of the same file (e.g. two different users
# changing a setting at the same moment — they hold different per-user locks,
# so _serialize_per_user can't help) run in parallel OS threads. Each one
# takes its snapshot at a slightly different time, and whichever thread's
# os.replace() happens to land LAST wins — which can be the OLDER snapshot,
# silently overwriting the newer one (a lost update).
#
# Fix: one asyncio.Lock per destination path. All writers of a given file
# queue up behind it and run strictly one at a time, in arrival order.
# Crucially the snapshot is taken INSIDE the lock (via `get_data`), not by
# the caller beforehand: a caller that snapshotted first and then waited for
# the lock would write a stale copy AFTER a fresher one had already landed.
# Taking it under the lock guarantees each write captures everything every
# earlier writer's mutation left behind, so the last write is always the
# newest state. Different files never block each other (separate locks).

# questions — built once per (year, day) and then IDENTICAL for every
# user in that year, so everyone's run (and the leaderboard ranking it
# feeds) is a level playing field. No mistakes-bank content is used here
# at all (that's exclusively the 🧠 Mistakes Bank menu button's own
# retake flow). Restricted to that year's DAILY_QUIZ_ACTIVE_MODULE by
# default, or to the admin-set /daily_module scope when one is set for
# that year as a temporary override (see get_daily_quiz_scope).
#
# Tapping the 💥Daily Quiz💥 main-menu button opens a small hub
# (show_daily_quiz_menu) that always shows the day's leaderboard for the
# user's own Year/Class (get_year_class — prompting them to set it first
# if they haven't), plus a Start button if they haven't run today's quiz
# yet. Gated to once per person per day via each user's settings
# "daily_quiz_last_date". Pushed to everyone at 2pm Cairo time once a day
# (see the job_queue.run_daily call in MAIN) as just a button into that
# same hub.
#
# Deliberately its own session type (DAILY_QUIZ_SESSIONS), separate from
# LECTURE_SESSIONS, rather than shoehorned into the lecture-session shape:
# a lecture session's dead-poll pruning, legacy-content recovery, and
# result-recording are all keyed to one specific year+lecture_key, which
# doesn't make sense for a session mixing many lectures/subjects at once.

# SESSION PERSISTENCE — LECTURE_SESSIONS / DAILY_QUIZ_SESSIONS /
# MISTAKES_RETAKE_SESSIONS were previously purely in-memory (see the file
# index note at the top of this file) — a restart mid-quiz dropped every
# active session, which is exactly the "الجلسة دي اتقفلت" path in
# handle_poll_answer. This mirrors REPORT_THREADS' persistence pattern
# (local JSON + a pinned backup in its own channel, restored on startup)
# but tuned for much hotter, throwaway data:
#
#   - Change detection is a content hash taken once per tick, not a
#     dirty flag set at each mutation site. Sessions are mutated from
#     many call sites across lecture/daily-quiz/mistakes-retake delivery
#     (_deliver_next_lecture_question, _advance_lecture_session,
#     _deliver_next_daily_question, _advance_daily_quiz_session, and
#     their mistakes-retake counterparts, plus the two session-creation
#     sites) — flagging every one individually risks silently missing a
#     spot as the file changes. A hash comparison of the whole snapshot
#     costs one json.dumps per tick, which is cheap at this data's size.
#   - The channel backup is throttled to once every
#     SESSIONS_BACKUP_MIN_INTERVAL seconds (30s), same idea as every
#     other backup_*_to_channel — but unlike analytics/settings/
#     lecture_results/mistakes_bank/report_threads, which now keep every
#     backup ever taken (see backup_analytics_to_channel's comment), this
#     ONE deletes the previous pinned message on each new upload. A 30s
#     cadence keeping full history would post thousands of documents a
#     day for data nobody needs a history of.
#   - A session older than SESSIONS_MAX_AGE_SECONDS (48h) is dropped on
#     restore rather than revived — see _cleanup_stale_sessions_job's own
#     6h idle-based cleanup, which already reclaims abandoned sessions
#     during normal operation; this 48h check is just what keeps a
#     restored snapshot from ever reviving something that old.
#   - _sessions_stale_sweep_job additionally re-runs that same 48h check
#     against the LIVE in-memory dicts every 48h, as an independent
#     backstop in case _cleanup_stale_sessions_job's hourly job was ever
#     down for an extended stretch (e.g. a JobQueue outage) — it only
#     removes entries already past 48h old, never active sessions, so it
#     can't interrupt anyone mid-quiz.

# QUESTION TIMEOUT — unsticking a timed quiz nobody's answering
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Auto-next delivery (Daily Quiz / lecture-auto / mistakes-retake /
# wrong-answer-retake — anywhere a single question is in flight at a
# time via session["current_poll_id"]) only ever advances from
# handle_poll_answer, which only fires when the user actually taps an
# option. A timed question's open_period makes Telegram auto-close the
# poll once it expires, but Telegram never tells the bot "nobody
# answered" — so with nothing else in place, a person who lets a timer
# run out just leaves their own quiz stuck forever, waiting on a
# poll_answer update that's never coming.
#
# The fix: _schedule_question_timeout books a one-off job a couple of
# seconds after the question's own open_period should have elapsed. If
# it's still the question the session is waiting on when that job fires
# (the person hasn't answered — handle_poll_answer would have moved
# current_poll_id on if they had), _handle_question_timeout treats it as
# a miss: the first one in a row is skipped exactly like a wrong answer
# and the quiz carries on as normal. A SECOND miss in a row instead
# pauses the session (rather than silently auto-skipping through
# whatever's left) and asks the person whether to resume or abandon it —
# see the qresume:/qabandon: handlers in button_handler.
#
# Batch-mode lecture sessions (every question sent up front, answerable
# in any order) have no single "current" question to time out this way,
# so this deliberately does nothing there — see the mode=="batch" check
# below.

# PASSIVE ANSWER BACKFILL
# Telegram pushes a fresh Update.poll (with correct_option_ids filled in)
# to any bot that has previously seen a poll, once that poll is stopped —
# even for polls the bot didn't create. If the original quiz's creator
# later ends it, we quietly backfill the answer with no user action needed.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# QUIZ POLL TIMEOUT — a session used to get stuck forever if a poll's
# open_period (the Settings question-timer) expired with nobody voting.
#
# Root cause: session progression only ever happened inside
# handle_poll_answer, which fires on a PollAnswer update — and Telegram
# ONLY sends PollAnswer when someone actually votes. If the timer runs
# out unanswered, Telegram still sends an Update.poll (is_closed=True —
# same shape as any other poll closing) but NEVER a PollAnswer for it,
# since nobody voted. Nothing was listening for that case, so the
# session just sat there permanently waiting for an answer that could
# never arrive.
#
# Fix: poll_update_handler (already registered for every Update.poll)
# now also checks, on every closed poll, whether it's still the
# in-flight question for a Daily Quiz / Mistakes Retake / lecture
# session — i.e. nothing has advanced that session past it yet, which
# is only possible if no PollAnswer ever came in for it. If so, treats
# it exactly like an incorrect answer and advances the session, same
# as handle_poll_answer would for any other wrong answer.
#
# If the user DID answer in time, handle_poll_answer has already
# advanced the session (cleared current_poll_id / popped it out of
# pending_polls) well before this ever runs, so the match below simply
# fails and this is a no-op — it only ever fires for a genuine timeout.

# QUIZZY POPUP EASTER EGGS
#
# A handful of toasts (query.answer(text), show_alert left False — a small
# banner that fades by itself, no OK button) on top of specific button
# taps — Quizzy (the bot's cat persona) getting a word in on top of
# whatever that button normally does. None of these ever block or change
# the underlying action. They're all decided in one place, _tap_toast,
# and shown by the single answer() at the top of button_handler — a tap
# can only be answered once, so a toast can't be raised from inside a
# branch after that.
#
# Two of the five scenarios this was scoped for don't fit this
# mechanism at all, because a toast only exists as a response to a
# button tap (a callback query) — there's no equivalent for a poll answer:
#   - "User gets 10/10" happens when the LAST question of a Daily
#     Quiz is answered — that's a poll vote (handle_poll_answer),
#     not a button tap, so there's no callback query to answer with
#     a popup. The perfect-score line is appended to the completion
#     summary message text instead — same joke, different delivery,
#     see _finish-daily-quiz block in handle_poll_answer.
#   - "User opens quizzes around 3–5 AM" is applied at every place a
#     user actually starts a quiz session via a button tap (Daily
#     Quiz, a lecture, a Mistakes Bank retake) rather than at every
#     screen that merely mentions quizzes, since "opens quizzes" reads
#     as starting one, not browsing a menu.

    # ── /report_issue — user sends a message, admin replies from
# REPORT_ISSUE_GROUP_ID, both sides visible on the same message, and the
# reporter can send follow-ups back into the same thread.
#
# Flow:
#   1. /report_issue -> AWAITING_REPORT_ISSUE[user_id] = time.time(), bot
#      asks for the text (optionally with a photo). Expires after
#      REPORT_ISSUE_AWAIT_TIMEOUT, and /cancel clears it early — either
#      way, a message sent after the wait lapsed is handled normally
#      instead of being swallowed as a report.
#   2. The user's next text (handle()) or photo (handle_image()) is
#      staged as a DRAFT (_stage_report_draft), not sent yet — they get a
#      preview back with "✅ ابعت" / "❌ إلغاء" buttons.
#   3. Tapping "✅ ابعت" (report_draft_send, in button_handler) calls
#      _submit_report, which does what step 2 used to do directly: posts
#      the card to REPORT_ISSUE_GROUP_ID with a "↩️ Reply" button, and
#      records it in REPORT_THREADS keyed by that group message's id —
#      this id is also shown on the card itself as the "Reply ID". A
#      photo, if any, goes out as its own message right after, threaded
#      under the card via reply_to_message_id (see _submit_report's
#      docstring for why it's not just the card's caption). Rejected if
#      more than REPORT_DRAFT_CONFIRM_TIMEOUT has passed since the draft
#      was staged. "❌ إلغاء" (report_draft_cancel) just discards it.
#   4. Admin replies one of two ways:
#        a) Type "-Reply <id> <text>" directly in the group. Preferred —
#           parsed straight out of the message text with no per-user
#           state, so it works even if the group has "remain anonymous"
#           enabled for admins (a typed message then arrives with
#           effective_user = GroupAnonymousBot, not the admin's real id,
#           which silently breaks any flow keyed on real_uid).
#        b) Tap the "↩️ Reply" button -> AWAITING_REPORT_REPLY[admin_id]
#           = {...}, bot asks for the text in the group, and the admin's
#           next message there is picked up in handle(). Kept as a
#           convenience alongside (a), with a same-chat fallback lookup
#           for the anonymous-admin case — see the comment at that check.
#      Either way: appended to the thread via _append_report_message, then
#      _refresh_report_thread posts the FULL thread as a fresh message to
#      BOTH sides (admin group card + reporter's DM, each with its own
#      Reply/Close or Reply button) and collapses whichever full-thread
#      message each side had before — see that function's docstring for
#      why a plain edit isn't enough (no push notification) and why the
#      old message is collapsed rather than left in place (no duplicate
#      thread dumps piling up).
#   5. Reporter taps their own "↩️ Reply" -> AWAITING_USER_FOLLOWUP[user_id]
#      = {...}; their next DM text is appended to the same thread (shown
#      to the admin under their name) and _refresh_report_thread runs
#      again, same as step 4. Blocked once the thread is closed.
#   6. Close just strips the buttons and marks the thread closed in place
#      (no new message on either side — it's not a reply) — no further
#      replies possible from that message (a re-tapped Reply, from either
#      side, is rejected with a toast/message).
#
# REPORT_THREADS is persisted the same way as MISTAKES_BANK: a local JSON
# file plus a pinned backup in REPORT_ISSUE_GROUP_ID, restored on startup
# (see restore_report_threads_from_channel). A restart mid-thread no
# longer loses the ability to keep replying to an old report — the thread
# reloads from the channel backup before polling starts. REPORT_DRAFTS
# (an unconfirmed draft between steps 2 and 3) is NOT persisted this way
# — it's short-lived, in-memory only, and a restart mid-draft just means
# the user re-does /report_issue, same as if the bot had been down when
# they first tried.

# upload/pin/delete-old-pin sequence is only logged, never retried.
# Almost always fine — but a dropped pin call or a delete that silently
# fails (message already gone, a transient timeout, etc.) can leave the
# channel's pinned message out of sync with what's actually on disk,
# and nothing would notice until the NEXT change came along to trigger
# another reactive backup.
#
# This job runs on a short timer instead of waiting for the next change:
# every BACKUP_RECONCILE_INTERVAL seconds, for each backup system
# (analytics, settings, lecture results, storage, and each configured
# year's quiz index), it checks whether the channel's current pin still
# matches the caption marker we expect. If the pin is missing, or belongs
# to a different marker (e.g. our own backup got unpinned by someone, or a
# delete-old-pin call left a stale one pinned instead), it just re-runs
# that system's normal backup_*_to_channel() — which re-uploads,
# re-pins, and cleans up the old message the same way it always does.
# Cheap: one get_chat per system per tick, and the throttle inside each
# backup_*_to_channel() call means this never spams uploads if
# everything's already fine.
